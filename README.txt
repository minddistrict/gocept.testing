==============
gocept.testing
==============

This package collects various helpers for writing tests.


assertEllipsis
==============

An assertion which is very helpful when using Testbrowser with
unittest.TestCase (instead of doctests).

Some examples::

    self.assertEllipsis('...bar...', 'foo bar qux')
    # -> nothing happens

    self.assertEllipsis('foo', 'bar')
    # -> AssertionError: Differences (ndiff with -expected +actual):
         - foo
         + bar

    self.assertNotEllipsis('foo', 'foo')
    # -> AssertionError: "Value unexpectedly matches expression 'foo'."

To use, inherit from ``gocept.testing.assertion.Ellipsis`` in addition to
``unittest.TestCase``.


assertNothingRaised
===================

An assertion that makes some tests more readable.
